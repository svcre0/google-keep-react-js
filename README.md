This is a demo version of a Google Keep-like app made with React.js. The app allows users to create, save, and delete notes. All other elements are static for now, with the interactive features being limited to note management.

Features
Create Notes: Click anywhere in the "Add a note" section to create a new note.
Save Notes: After entering your content, click outside the note container to save it.
Delete Notes: Press the delete icon  to remove .![ScreenShot Tool -20250206104438](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46571dce-5778-4388-a9db-942bffe6873c)
